Basic instructions for installing Python on a Windows 11 computer

Install Python 3:

Go to the official Python website. [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Download the latest version of Python 3.
Run the installer. Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
To verify the installation, open Command Prompt and run:
**python --version**

Install Required Packages:

This python script will require you to also install some free add-on packages. Some of these will come by default with python itself, but you should check for each:
* sys
* os
* sqlite3
* re

To install an add-on package, use pip3, which comes with Python. For example, to install the SQLite library, at your command prompt:
**pip3 install sqlite3**
If it is already included in your installation of python, this will just check and confirm that.

Install SQLite3 Command Line Interpreter (optional):

Download it from SQLite website. [SQLite command line interpreter](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
Download the Windows package (a .zip file) and extract it.
Place the sqlite3.exe file in a directory of your choice.
Add that directory to your system's PATH environment variable to run it from Command Prompt easily.

If you plan to only use a graphical interface to your HLM database, you don't need the command line interpreter.
The provided python script does everything to create the sqlite database, tables, and indexes, for you.

Install DBeaver - a free sql graphical frontend (optional)
Dbeaver is one of many free graphical programs you can use to work with any sqlite database such as the one created by this python script.
To get Dbeaver for Windows, go to:
[Dbeaver home page](https://dbeaver.com/docs/dbeaver/)
To learn more about using Dbeaver specifically with an SQLite database, see:
[Dbeaver and SQLite](https://dbeaver.com/docs/dbeaver/Database-driver-SQLite/)
