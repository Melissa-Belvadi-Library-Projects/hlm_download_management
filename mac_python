Mac OSX installation of python, sqlite, and Dbeaver

Your Mac OSX computer probably has python already installed.
To check, open your terminal and run this:
python3 --version

If you don't have it, you can get it (free) from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install any required packages, use:
pip3 install sqlite3
or whatever package you need.
If you already have that package, pip3 will tell you that.

You might also already have the sqlite3 command line interpreter (optional).
to check, run in terminal:
sqlite3 --version

If you don't have it but you do use homebrew, you can get it with:
brew install sqlite3

or get it directly from the SQLite website:
https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

If you plan to do everything in a graphical front end like DBeaver, you don't need the sqlite command line interpreter, but it can be nice to have.
Melissa recommends the free Dbeaver graphical package.
